We select only those above your quality thresholds (and within your volume targets) for inclusion.\n\nEmail Composition and Portal Sync: For each selected opportunity, we present the core facts (codes, value, due date, buyer) plus short‑form analysis (strengths, considerations, recommendation). Every opportunity is written into your Pulse portal queue, so the email is a jump‑off point, not the sole record.\n\nTriage and Decision Rhythm: Your team uses the daily email to spot what needs attention now, then moves into the portal to save, de‑prioritize, or request deeper analysis. Over time, the alerts and decisions create a living record of what you pursue and why.\n\nOngoing Tuning and Optional Strategy Support: We revisit your profile periodically and adjust codes, keywords, and thresholds based on feedback and results. If you opt for the Alerts + Strategy tier, we schedule regular sessions to review your pipeline and shape your pursuit plan.\n\nStarting Assumptions / Inputs (Prerequisites):\n• You have or are willing to define a clear target profile: core offerings, target agencies/markets, preferred NAICS/PSCs and geographies\n• You are willing to own a primary POC who can respond to profile questions and approve adjustments\n• You are able to receive and act on daily emails (basic inbox hygiene and access to the GovPointe Pulse portal)\n• You understand that the service is signal‑enhancement, not perfection: some iterations may be needed before the mix of volume and relevance is exactly right",
